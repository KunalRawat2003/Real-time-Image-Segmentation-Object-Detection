# <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 & Streamlit </span>

This repository is an extensive open-source project showcasing the seamless integration of **object detection and tracking** using **YOLOv8** (object detection algorithm), along with **Streamlit** (a popular Python web application framework for creating interactive web apps). The project offers a user-friendly and customizable interface designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from sources such as RTSP, UDP, and YouTube URLs, as well as static videos and images.


## <span style="color:deepskyblue">WebApp Demo on Streamlit Server</span>

Thank you team [Streamlit](<https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit>) for the community support for the cloud upload. 

This app is up and running on Streamlit cloud server!!! You can check the demo of this web application on this link

### Segmentation task on image

## Requirements

Python 3.10
YOLOv8
Streamlit

```bash
pip install ultralytics streamlit pytube
```

## Installation
- Change to the repository directory:
```
 C:\Users\rajku\OneDrive\Desktop\Real-time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-with-YOLOv8-Streamlit

```

- create conda environment:
```
conda create -n detection python=3.8 -y
```
- activate environment:
```
conda activate detection
```

- Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/kundan-raj301/Real-time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-with-YOLOv8-Streamlit.git

```

- Create `weights`, `videos`, and `images` directories inside the project.

- Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights from (<https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt>) and save them to the `weights` directory in the same project.

## Usage

- Run the app with the following command: 
```
streamlit run app.py
```
- The app should open in a new browser window.

### ML Model Config

- Select task (Detection, Segmentation)
- Select model confidence
- Use the slider to adjust the confidence threshold (25-100) for the model.

One the model config is done, select a source.

### Detection on images

- The default image with its objects-detected image is displayed on the main page.
- Select a source. (radio button selection `Image`).
- Upload an image by clicking on the "Browse files" button.
- Click the "Detect Objects" button to run the object detection algorithm on the uploaded image with the selected confidence threshold.
- The resulting image with objects detected will be displayed on the page. Click the "Download Image" button to download the image.("If save image to download" is selected)

## Detection in Videos

- Create a folder with name `videos` in the same directory
- Dump your videos in this folder
- In `settings.py` edit the following lines.

```python
# video
VIDEO_DIR = ROOT / 'videos' # After creating the videos folder

# Suppose you have four videos inside videos folder
# Edit the name of video_1, 2, 3, 4 (with the names of your video files) 
VIDEO_1_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_1.mp4' 
VIDEO_2_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_2.mp4'
VIDEO_3_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_3.mp4'
VIDEO_4_PATH = VIDEO_DIR / 'video_4.mp4'

# Edit the same names here also.
VIDEOS_DICT = {
    'video_1': VIDEO_1_PATH,
    'video_2': VIDEO_2_PATH,
    'video_3': VIDEO_3_PATH,
    'video_4': VIDEO_4_PATH,
}

# Your videos will start appearing inside streamlit webapp 'Choose a video'.
```

- Click on `Detect Video Objects` button and the selected task (detection/segmentation) will start on the selected video.

### Detection on RTSP

- Select the RTSP stream button
- Enter the rtsp url inside the textbox and hit `Detect Objects` button

### Detection on YouTube Video URL

- Select the source as YouTube
- Copy paste the url inside the text box.
- The detection/segmentation task will start on the YouTube video url
